## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

- Using `linear-gradient` on borders with `border-radius`
- Considerations in making an accessible toggle button

### Continued development

I can improve the solution by:

- Saving the user theme choice in local storage for their next visit
- Use the `prefers-color-scheme` media query to set the theme to their OS preference.

### Useful resources

- ['An accessible toggle' by Kitty Giraudel](https://kittygiraudel.com/2021/04/05/an-accessible-toggle) - A detailed walkthrough of a HTML + CSS only implementation of an accessible toggle. This inspired me to include the check and cross icons in the toggle to make the choices clearer.
- ['A complete guide to dark mode on the web' by CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-dark-mode-on-the-web/) - Outlines different approaches to implementing dark mode.
